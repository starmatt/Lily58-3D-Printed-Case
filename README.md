# Starry58

Hello !

**Starry58** is a case for the
[Lily58 split keyboard](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58).
The case is *high profile*, it features *integrated switch plates*,
optional *M3 tenting holes*, and allows to be set up with *acrylic bottom
plates*.

This case is inspired by the
[IMK Corne case](https://imkulio.com/build-guide.html) and the
[Manta58](https://teddit.net/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/r0mptz/ic_manta58_a_unique_3dprinted_lily58_case/).

## How to build

### 3D printing

You will need LEFT and RIGHT versions of the case (you can find the .STL files
in the `Exports` folder). You can 3D print the parts yourself or use a third
party service. (The case you see in the pictures was printed at
[i.materialise.com](https://i.materialise.com/en/multiple-file-upload) with SLS
technology and a polished finish).

:warning: The case is heavy on support material.

### Bottom plates

Starry58 allows for 3mm acrylic bottom plates based on the bottom plates of the
[official case](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58/tree/master/case). You can
use a third party service to have them cut, or you can buy an acrylic sandwich
case at third party vendors (such as
[Splitkb](https://splitkb.com/products/lily58-acrylic-plate-case) and
[Keycapsss](https://keycapsss.com/keyboard-parts/cases/82/lily58-acrylic-plate-case)),
which will come with the necessary hardware to screw the case and plates together.

### Hardware

To be able to screw the bottom plates to the switch plates, you will need:

- M2x6mm screws x20
- M2x6mm spacers x10

### Tenting hardware (optional)
